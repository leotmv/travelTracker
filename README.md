If you want to run this code locally, I highly recommend to you to follow the steps below:
I was using Visual Studio code as IDE to help me run all codes. Try this one too.
Make sure you are using Node.js,
Install packages using the command npm i in your terminal. I reccomend to you to use nodemon module to run the frontend and the backend at same time.
Make sure you have some connection with postgreSQL. I highly recommend to install pgAdmin 4. Create an account for you and use the query tool to insert each query in queries.sql.
Make sure you know and provide your password you entered in postgreSQL account because you will need this password to input in index.js (space specified)
In your browser, paste this url to run the code: http://localhost:3001/
